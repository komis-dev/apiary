# A little about Blueprint

The Blueprint for an Application Programming Interface. It's a robust, high-level language for describing web APIs.
Every person who has any hand in the API lifecycle will find API Blueprint to be an easy and accessible tool. It has a grammar that is both brief and evocative. API Blueprint is a tool for rapidly designing and prototyping future APIs, as well as for documenting and testing APIs that have already been deployed, including those that are crucial to business operations.

API Blueprint was developed with the intention of inspiring more abstract API design. API Blueprint is meant to encapsulate the behavior of the backend implementation while also decoupling its components to allow for modularity.

Finally, it's worth mentioning that the styling concept lies at the heart of API Blueprint. The API Blueprint is a covenant for an API, analogous to tests in experimental development. Better API designs are often the result of pre-development considerations on the API and the protocol.

When your API Blueprint is finalized, anybody may verify that it is being implemented as planned.
